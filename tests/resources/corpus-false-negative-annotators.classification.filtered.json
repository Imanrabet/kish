Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed during scanning. No participant reported falling asleep during the scan when routinely asked immediately after scanning. FMRI data were collected using a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000ms, TE = 30ms, Diverse Amygdala-Frontal Connectivity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24cm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64). Thirty-five axial slices were collected with 3-mm thickness without gap. For spatial normalization and localization, a 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to acquire high-resolution structural images (TR = 7.1ms, TE = 3.2ms, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24cm, matrix = 240 \u00d7 240, slice thickness = 1.0mm without gap, 176 slices, 1 averages). Image preprocessing was carried out using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) (http:// www.restfmri.net). Preprocessing using SPM5 consisted of slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing full width at half maximum (FWHM = 6mm). Movement parameters were examined for each participant. Data sets with more than 2mm maximum translation in x, y or z, or 2\u00b0 of maximum rotation about 3 axes between each image were excluded. Preprocessing using REST consisted of removing linear drift through linear regression and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of lowfrequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise."

A maximal repeat 26) is a repeat that cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a mismatch. The total number of maximal repeats in a sequence of size n is linear (less than n) which is interesting since the computation may be done in linear time using a suffix-tree-based algorithm. A CRISPR pattern of two DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence of approximately the same length."

Image quality control was performed using standardized procedures (Simmons et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2009). Next, the raw 3D T1 MRI data underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer image analysis software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) version 5.1 installed on a CentOS4 x86_64 cluster. There are several rationales for using Freesurfer in our study. Firstly, the surface-based registration approach incorporated into this software has been shown to have better reproducibility compared to Laplacian-or Registration-based methods for cortical thickness estimation (Clarkson et al., 2011). Secondly, this framework provides a range of different kinds of surface-based and volumetric measurements, as well as different parcellation atlases for extracting averaged morphometric data. The steps of this processing are described in detail elsewhere (S\u00e9gonne et al., 2007; S\u00e9gonne et al., 2004; Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999; Dale et al., 1999; Sled et al., 1998)."

For parameter estimation and hypothesis testing the complementary combination of f requentist (orthodox) and Bayesian approaches was used. Nonparametric bootstrapping and permutation (Monte Carlo) procedures were realized with the number of replicates and/or random permutations as large as possible (but no less than 1 million).

We then create a bipartite graph G, in which genes in O 1 and O 2 are represented as vertices and for each pair of homologous genes defined above, we create an edge between the two genes and use their sequence similarity as their weight in the graph G. The weight of the maximum weighted bipartite matching (8) for graph G is defined as the similarity score between operons O 1 and O 2 .

The entire lane was excised, divided into 16 pieces, and prepared for MS analysis by in-gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion. The eluted samples were then analyzed by reverse-phase nano-electrospray tandem MS as described previously (Mead et al., 2010).

The results show that, similar to the objective data, controlling for a country's income, respondents from volunteer collection countries are more likely to believe their country is collecting blood effi ciently and distributing it fairly (p < .05). However, respondent's perceptions of the safety to either the donor or recipient do not vary with the percent of blood collected from volunteers (p > .85). Percent of blood donations with TTI that would have revealed little or no shift in demand. Spikes in donations, combined that would have revealed little or no shift in demand. Spikes in donations, combined with six week shelf life for whole blood, along with technical constraints and collec-with six week shelf life for whole blood, along with technical constraints and collection agency policies, have led to destroying blood supply after national disasters. Starr (2002) documents that over 570,000 additional units of blood were collected Starr (2002) documents that over 570,000 additional units of blood were collected by the Red Cross immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, with an estimated by the Red Cross immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, with an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 units eventually discarded (plus the time and equipment wasted 100,000 to 300,000 units eventually discarded (plus the time and equipment wasted collecting these units), for an estimated minimum cost of $21-63 million (using collecting these units), for an estimated minimum cost of $21-63 million (using the $211 unit cost reported above). Well-publicized images of lines outside blood the $211 unit cost reported above). Well-publicized images of lines outside blood donor centers immediately after 9/11 likely exacerbated the problem by signaling donor centers immediately after 9/11 likely exacerbated the problem by signaling that donating was the normatively appropriate behavioral response (Cialdini et al. that donating was the normatively appropriate behavioral response (Cialdini et al. 1993), despite virtually no change in demand for blood. 1993), despite virtually no change in demand for blood. Of course, one option for collection agencies to address excess supply is to Of course, one option for collection agencies to address excess supply is to separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma, with the idea that at least the plasma separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma, with the idea that at least the plasma can be stored, although the red cells would still be discarded after six weeks. This can be stored, although the red cells would still be discarded after six weeks. This option is limited by centrifuge and fi ltration capacity constraints. When a disaster option is limited by centrifuge and fi ltration capacity constraints. When a disaster response is local, supply can be shipped to other locations having centrifuge and response is local, supply can be shipped to other locations having centrifuge and fi ltration capacity.

However, when disaster responses are spread over a larger area or are national in scope, there is nowhere to send the excess supply. Yet another or are national in scope, there is nowhere to send the excess supply. Yet another option is for collection agencies to turn away volunteer donors, though this policy option is for collection agencies to turn away volunteer donors, though this policy has not usually been followed for fear that volunteers may take this as a signal that has not usually been followed for fear that volunteers may take this as a signal that they should not bother donating in the future. they should not bother donating in the future."

                    "full_context": "Tables 1 and Appendix Table 4 shows two major differences between the mergers we were able to examine and those that we excluded. First, overall, the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets. For instance, three of the 12 excluded mergers took place in very small markets (with fewer than 10 stores), and only one merger took place in a large market (Supervalu's purchases of the Jewel/Osco chain in Chicago). Second, in part because the excluded mergers took place in smaller markets, these markets tended to be more concentrated premerger. For example, Table 1 shows that three of the studied mergers studied took place in unconcentrated markets (with an HHI <1,500), while only one of the omitted mergers took place in an unconcentrated market. 31 To provide the reader with a sense of how the mergers affected market concentration in the regions located close to the merging firms' stores, we have also calculated the level and change of the HHI in the region immediately surrounding each of the merging firms' stores (defined as a 6-mile circle centered at the location of a store owned by one of the two merging firms). By construction, this technique generates as many \"local markets\" as there are stores owned by the merging firms. The online Appendix Table 4 presents descriptive statistics of the empirical distributions of the level and change in market concentration corresponding to each of the 14 studied mergers. Qualitatively, market concentration measured at the CBSA level and within the region immediately surrounding the affected stores were quite similar (with a correlation coefficient of 0.92). The level of market concentration (HHI) in the smaller regions tends to be larger than in the CBSA because (in most cases) fewer independent firms operate within subregions of a CBSA. 32 Most studies that exploit geographic variation in how mergers affect pricing using an identification strategy similar to ours. Examples include studies of mergers in the airline industry (Borenstein, 1990;Kim & Singal 1993), banking (Prager & Hannan, 1998;Focarelli & Panetta, 2003), gasoline refining and distribution (Taylor & Hosken 2007;Simpson &Taylor 2008), andhospitals (Haas-Wilson &Garmon 2011;Tenn 2011). 33 To our knowledge, the synthetic control estimator has not been used to estimate the price impact of mergers. 34 We use the Stata code developed by Sergio Correia (reghdfe.ado) available at https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457874.html (last visited September 23,2016). 35 For the larger mergers we have been able to identify the dates the transactions closed, for example, A&P's merger with Pathmark. For smaller mergers, such as the transfer of ownership of a handful of stores in a small CBSA, we have not been able to identify the precise date the merger became effective. 36 Two of the mergers (in Evansville and Topeka) were consummated in the first half of 2008. For these transactions, we assume the effects of the merger are felt within 6 months. That is, pricing observed in 2009 represents how prices changed as the result of the merger. model. 50 The postmerger HHI is equal to the sum of the premerger HHI and the change in HHI shown in Table 1. 51 This can be more clearly seen in the figure in the appendix that plots the change in market concentration and the change in price (the analogue to Figure 2). 52 We have also examined the relationship between the postmerger level of concentration or change in concentration using alternative measures of market concentration, (e.g., market concentration measured within either 3 or 6 miles of a store owned by the merging firms). In all cases, we find qualitatively similar results to those shown in Figure 2: both the level of postmerger concentration and the change in concentration are positively correlated with the change in postmerger prices. However, only the level of postmerger concentration is statistically related to postmerger prices (at either the 5 % or 10% significance level). The results from this analysis are shown in online Appendix Table 7. 53 Antitrust economists have developed a number of techniques to measure the intensity of competition between competing retailers beyond market concentration to help identify which retailing mergers are most likely to be problematic (see Hosken & Tenn [2016]for a recent survey). 54 In related work, Hosken, Olson, and Smith (2016) examine the efficacy of using market entry and exit studies to forecast the likely competitive impact of horizontal mergers. Implicitly, this methodological approach assumes that the price impact of entry (exit) is the reverse of (the same as) a horizontal merger. That is, the estimated reduction in market prices following entry would be roughly the same magnitude (but opposite in sign) as a horizontal merger of similar size. Hosken, Olson, and Smith evaluate this methodological approach by estimating the price impact of market entry and exit in the supermarket industry. They conclude that studies of market exit are unlikely to inform merger analysis (more often than not market exit is associated with reductions in market price). Their findings for entry studies are more promising. Although the authors find evidence that the price impact of entry is biased down (in absolute value), overall, significant market entry appears to lower market prices. Moreover, when the authors compare the estimated price impact of entry to the estimated price effects of mergers found in this study, they note that they are of a similar magnitude. For this reason, Hosken, Olson, and Smith conclude that well-executed entry studies can provide useful information to aid antitrust enforcers in identifying potentially anticompetitive mergers."

To simplify exposition, we derive the estimator for the case in which data on test scores is available for t years for all teachers, where all classes have n students, and where each teacher teaches one class per year. In online Appendix A, we provide a step-by-step guide to implementation (along with corresponding Stata code) which accounts for differences in class size, multiple classrooms per year, and other technical issues which arise in practice."

                    "full_context": "As discussed, the majority of the evidence supporting microRNA annotations now comes from deep-sequencing experiments. We have developed an interface to view reads from RNA deep-sequencing data mapped to microRNA loci on the miRBase web site. Briefly, we identify entries in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .gov/geo/) with short-read data that map to references discovering novel microRNAs. We extract the read sequences and counts from the GEO entry and map the reads to the set of miRBase hairpin sequences for a given organism using Bowtie (6) allowing at most two mismatches between the read and the hairpin sequence. The first deep-sequencing data sets incorporated into miRBase are from human, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and three nematode genomes. Additional data sets will be added rapidly. Ideally, all microRNA sequences submitted to miRBase will be linked to GEO submissions, or followed by the submission of the deep-sequencing data for inclusion in miRBase. The view of deep-sequencing data can be accessed from miRBase stem-loop and mature pages (Figure 2). Reads can be filtered by the number of mismatches to the hairpin sequence, the read count and by experiment. Each experiment is annotated with species, tissue, stage and methodology information. These tags enable the user to search for experiments by tissue expression on the miRBase search page (http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml). Read counts for mature microRNAs are commonly used as a proxy for relative expression levels. As the number of deepsequencing experiments increases, these data provide extensive information about the expression profiles of microRNAs across tissues, stages and organisms. A good example of the power of these data can be seen in the small RNA data made available through the MODENCODE project for D. melanogaster (7). The patterns of read mappings also provide valuable evidence for relative abundance of mature sequences from different arms, for isoforms of mature microRNA sequences, and for the confidence in a given microRNA annotation. For example, Figure 2 shows a number of isoforms of mature microRNAs derived from both arms of the dme-mir-317 hairpin precursor. The dominant mature sequence from the 3 0 -arm is 21 nt in length, whereas the mature sequence annotated in miRBase 16 is extended to 24 nt. The 5 0 -mature sequence is unannotated in miRBase 16. The miRBase view of read data therefore provides the user with a clear picture of the profile of short RNAs generated from a microRNA locus, and facilitates the correction of errors and omissions in future releases."

We then used the Bing Maps Application Programming Interface (https://www.microsoft.com/maps/) to determine the distance between each pair of CBSAs and hence the distance from each CBSA to its nearest neighbor. Finally, we used the crosswalk detailed above to match CBSAs to MSAs. When multiple CBSAs matched to an MSA, we used the average distance. Because the crosswalk uses more recent MSA definitions than IPUMS, we exclude metropolitan areas that do not match uniquely to the MSAs in the crosswalk (indicating code changes between the crosswalk and IPUMS definitions). 24 That is, we replace the l jt and r jt in the formulae given above with the sample analogs of E\u00f0q hjt jh 6 \u00bc i\u00de and Ef\u00bdq hjt 2E\u00f0q hjt jh 6 \u00bc i\u00de 2 jh 6 \u00bc ig 1=2 ."

The scores are calculated from separate pairwise alignments using the dynamic programming method. A consensus sequence was obtained and compared with the Tuf sequences of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei-paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactococcus lactis, and sequences of primers and probes of highly specific real-time PCR were established. The primer and probe sequences are reported in Supplementary Table  The duplex real-time PCR was executed as described above and in Armougom et al. 12 The specificity was tested on the DNA of the reference strains reported in Supplementary table 1. The stool-purified DNA was analyzed in samples that were pure, diluted at 1/10, and diluted at 1/ 100 to confirm the absence of inhibitors. Negative controls were included on each plate. The different lactobacilli, B. animalis and Lactococcus lactis were quantified using a plasmid standard curve from 10 7 -10 copies per assay."

As we know, gene identification methods may be classified as recognition of protein coding regions and recognition of functional sites of genes. In the past two decades, many new methods for finding distinctive features of protein coding regions have been presented, including the algorithms based on codon usage (1 ), dicodon usage (2 ), 3-base periodicity (3)(4)(5), and the fifth-order phase Markov chain model (6 ). Although great progress has been made, the situation is still far from being perfect. Undoubtedly, the fifth-order Markov chain model has a better identification accuracy, since this method makes full use of the local statistical characteristics of base distribution in three frames of coding sequences. However, it still has its shortcomings; the parameters determined based on previously discovered sequences cannot be applied to identify genes on different sequences with the same accuracy (7 ). Moreover, it needs a large data set to train the bulky parameters, whose number is nearly five thousand. In recent years, several new algorithms have been proposed, such as MZEF (8 ), GLIMMER (9 ), MOR-GAN  (10 ), GeneMark.hmm (11 ), GENESCAN (12 ), FGENESH (13 ), and so on (14 , 15 ). An up-todate list of references is maintained by Wentian Li (http://www.nslij-genetics.org/gene/; ref. 16 ). And a powerful gene finding program, BGF (Beijing Gene Finder), is proposed by Beijing Genomics Institute (http://bgf.genomics.org.cn/). These algorithms, which use both coding information and splicing signals, perform better than those using only splicing signals (17 ). However, there is still the need of new methods for gene prediction, which utilize features of gene structure that have so far not been incorporated into programs already available (7 )."

The coordinates of spots were extracted in Matlab and track histories generated using a Matlab version of the IDL nearest-neighbor algorithm (www.physics.emory.edu/\u223cweeks/idl/). To detect the very faint mApp-\u03b22AR (+) scission events, the fluorescence of candidate spots was quantified using a circle-minus-annulus measurement in which segmented spots were excluded from the annulus. This eliminated a major source of noise in the fluorescence measurement and allowed a more accurate estimate of fluorescence."

Mouse kidneys were fixed in 10% buffered formalin saline (Thermo Scientific, Runcorn, UK) for 24 hours. Fixed kidneys were processed and paraffin embedded according to standard procedures. A series of 5-\u03bcm coronal kidney sections was prepared at 200-\u03bcm intervals from each kidney. Kidney sections were hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained and scanned to create virtual HE slides using an Aperio system (http://www.aperio. com/?gclid = CNXN-8by4a UCFcINfAods3eg1w). Virtual slides were used for lesion quantification. Maximum cross-sectional whole area and cellular area of each renal lesion were measured, respectively, using ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Cellular areas of renal lesions were obtained from parenchyma and stroma. To estimate average size of tumor cells, cysts and papillary and solid tumors on HE-stained kidney sections were randomly chosen using ImageJ. Average size of tumor cells was determined from parenchyma (not stroma) through total area of all tumor cells divided by the number of tumor cells examined. Analysis was conducted blindly with respect to treatment status."

The XhoI and NotI restriction endonuclease sites incorporated into the sense and antisense primers above are shown in boldface. After PCR amplification, the amplicon was double digested with XhoI/ NotI for 2 hours following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites downstream of the Renilla luciferase (r-luc) reporter gene (psiCHECK-2; Promega). The authenticity and orientation of the inserts relative to the Renilla luciferase gene were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The resulting recombinant plasmids were designated psiCHECK/CDK6-UTR. Finally, transformed bacterial cultures were grown and each reporter construct was purified the PureLink Hipure Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Invitrogen)."

The root (level 0) describes three main GO categories at level 1, which are \"biological process\", \"molecular function\" and \"cellular component\". We used GO terms only from the \"biological process\" and \"molecular function\" categories because the data for the \"cellular component\" category are very sparse. Ideally, we would have used GO terms that provide specific descriptions on the processes or functions; however, the more specific the terms get, the less frequent they are, which prohibits meaningful comparison of GO term frequencies across different cancer. Hence, we chose the GO terms at level 4 for our analysis because at this level, GO terms are more specific (than those at previous levels), while generic enough to cover broader groups of related processes or functions to attain reasonable cumulative frequency for analysis. All the GO terms associated with a protein sequence were obtained from the GO database as graph paths, which have an inherent hierarchical order starting from the root (level 0). Since our goal is to compare the number of common GO terms across different cancer types, these GO terms must be selected at the same level in the graph path (for all cancers) to make the comparison meaningful. We developed a Perl program to store all the graph paths for a given protein. Using this program, under each GO category (except the \"cellular component\"), the common GO terms for a given pair of PPIs were determined at level 4 to calculate the frequency of common GO terms in a given cancer. Since the size of PPI dataset (Table 1) varies across different cancer types, frequencies of common GO terms were normalized against the number of PPIs, showing at least one common GO term in each cancer dataset. This normalization ensures a fair comparison of the common GO term frequencies across different cancer types irrespective of the size of PPI datasets used. The top 20 most frequent common terms were selected from each cancer, which were combined to obtain a nonredundant set of GO terms under the biological process and the molecular function categories, respectively."

Direct MTA targets could be of higher impact than the indirect signaling pathway in question. Oncogenes' alterations because of their impact on inducing cancer could be considered more deleterious than TSG alterations and consequently considered of higher impact in treatment algorithms. For example, when a tumor sample from a patient enrolled in a PM trial harbors an activating mutation of BRAF (V600E) and a homozygous deletion in PTEN, the inhibition of BRAF using vemurafenib should be considered of higher priority as compared with the use of an AKT or an mTOR inhibitor. An important criterion in prioritizing molecular alterations is also the presence of downstream resistance biomarkers. These data  review should be considered together with technical issues and thresholds (Table 5)."

But especially striking is that Rosling has founded a nonprofit software provider called Gapminder to provide vivid moving illustrations of how countries' health and economic statistics evolve over time.

This is the case for the organellar database (20) as well as the red blood cell database (21), as both datasets are exclusively protein-based and therefore cannot be mapped to MAPU 2.0 due to the lack of peptide information. MAPU 2.0 is based on a modern and scalable software architecture, namely C# and the ASP.NET technology. This allows MAPU 2.0 to share class libraries, with PHOSIDA (15). The concepts and web applications of MAPU 2.0 and PHOSIDA are very similar and show that very distinct proteomic databases can be built using shared components."

The basic schema of the database has changed dramatically, and the new database version unifies all sub-databases by reassigning the measured peptides along with their corresponding data from each experiment to protein entries of an updated database version. The new architecture is based in part on concepts developed for the Phosphorylation Site Database [PHOSIDA; www.phosida.com (14,15)]. It allows the organism-specific retrieval of various cell-type and organelle associated proteomic data. The user can query the database organism-specifically by protein name, protein description, gene symbol, accession of the database used for identification [such as the International Protein Index (IPI) ( 16)], SwissProt accession identifier, protein sequence or peptide sequence (Figure 1, left panel). If more than one protein entry matches with the submitted query string, MAPU 2.0 will list all relevant proteins and mark the ones identified in at least one proteomic experiment, in red (Figure 1, middle panel). Clicking on one of the red highlighted entries leads to the result page (Figure 1, right panel). If there is just a single match to the query, the web user will be guided directly to the result page describing the inquired protein. The left panel of the resulting web page displays investigated cell types and tissues. If the protein was detected in a certain sub-proteome, the corresponding button is highlighted (Figure 1, right panel). Otherwise, the image of the tissue or cell type is illustrated in light colors indicating the absence of the specified protein of interest. Clicking on one of the buttons on the left panel results in the complete listing of all peptides that have been measured in the selected cell type along with associated data such as peptide identification scores or identification scores for post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Figure 2)."
